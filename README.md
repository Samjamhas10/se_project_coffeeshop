## Specialty Coffee in the Triple Peaks Library

This project is a coffee shop landing page designed to showcase a variety of web development techniques. I used HTML and CSS to build the site, implementing key elements such as:

- Headings
- Lists
- Links
- Custom forms

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform


## Plan on improving the project

While working on the project, I aim to enhance the menu's background image to match the header's background. Utilizing a cohesive color palette, particularly shades of blue, will improve the overall appearance of the website. Additionally, I plan to incorporate more animations to make the website more interactive.
