# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform


## Plan on improving the project

While working on the project, I aim to enhance the menu's background image to match the header's background. Utilizing a cohesive color palette, particularly shades of blue, will improve the overall appearance of the website. Additionally, I plan to incorporate more animations to make the website more interactive. 

## Specialty Coffee in the Triple Peaks Library

This project is centered around a coffee shop landing page that offers a wide range of features. I used HTML and CSS to add interactivity and functionality to the website. The technological elements I implemented include headings, lists, and links.
