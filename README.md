## Specialty Coffee in the Triple Peaks Library

This project is a coffee shop landing page designed to showcase a variety of web development techniques. I used HTML and CSS to build the site, implementing key elements such as:

- Headings
- Lists
- Links
- Custom forms

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- Fix the menu section's inconsistent background using the same background image as the header to create a more cohesive visual design
- Fix the page using additional CSS animations and trasnistions to make the site more dynamic and interactive
