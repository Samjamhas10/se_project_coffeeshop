# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form

## Plan on improving the project

While working on the project, I would like to implement the menu's background image to match the header's background. Using specific colors would improve the look of the website. For example, staying on track with the blue colors. Another thing I would like to improve is adding more animations to make the website more interactive. One last thing I would like to put into effect would be adding more interesting fonts in correlation with their respective pages.

## Specialty Coffee in the Triple Peaks Library

HTML and CSS were used to add interactivity and functionality to the website. This project is about a coffee shop landing page that has a lot to offer. This project focuses on a coffee shop landing page that offers many features. The technologies elements I utilized include headings, lists, and links.
